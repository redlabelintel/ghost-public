## The Workflow

### Tool Chain

```
Opus 4.6 (Anthropic's best model)
    ↓
Cursor (AI-powered IDE)
    ↓
Figma (Design tool)
```

### What It Means

**Traditional Design Process**:
1. Designer brainstorms concepts
2. Creates wireframes
3. Develops high-fidelity mockups
4. Iterates based on feedback
5. Hours to days per design

**AI-Powered Process**:
1. Describe design intent to Opus
2. Cursor translates to Figma code/plugins
3. Figma renders design automatically
4. Iterate via conversation
5. Minutes per design

### The "Unfair" Advantage

**AK's Realization**: The gap between AI-assisted and traditional design is becoming insurmountable.

**The Result**: Designer can "sit there and enjoy life" while AI does the work.
