## The Prompt

> "What's the single smartest and most radically innovative and accretive and useful and compelling addition you can make to my agent's capabilities?"

## Why This Matters

This is a meta-prompt designed to stress-test your agent architecture. Instead of incremental feature requests, it forces frontier models to identify the **highest-leverage single addition** that would transform capability.

## Key Principles

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| "Smartest" | Forces technical depth |
| "Radically innovative" | Breaks incremental thinking |
| "Accretive" | Must compound value over time |
| "Useful" | Must solve real problems |
| "Compelling" | Must justify its own existence |

## Strategic Value

1. **Escapes local maxima** — Prevents optimizing the wrong thing
2. **Reveals blind spots** — Different models identify different gaps
3. **Benchmarks architecture** — Tests if your agent can even articulate what's missing
4. **Prioritizes ruthlessly** — Single constraint forces hard choices

## Recommended Usage

Run this prompt against:
- Claude Opus 4.6 (systematic, thorough)
- o1 Pro (novel architectures)
- Gemini 2.0 Flash (efficient execution paths)
- Grok 3 (unconstrained ideation)

Compare answers. The overlap is your true gap. The outliers are experiments worth trying.

## Application to Ghost

Current architecture strengths:
- ✅ Local model deployment (cost zero)
- ✅ Daily AI digest + action tracking
- ✅ Multi-skill framework
- ✅ Memory system (Supabase hybrid)

Potential radical additions to evaluate:
- **Self-healing harness** — Agent diagnoses and patches its own failure modes
- **Predictive orchestration** — Anticipates user needs before explicit request
- **Cross-session learning** — Transfers insights across unrelated sessions
- **Autonomous skill creation** — Writes and tests new skills without human loop

## Verdict

**Keep.** This is a diagnostic tool, not a feature. Bookmark the results from running it quarterly.
