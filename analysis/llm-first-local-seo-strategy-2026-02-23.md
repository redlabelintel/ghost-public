## The Claim

Local HVAC company mentioned by ChatGPT in 72 hours—**without traditional SEO**.

## The Mechanism

Contrary to popular belief, LLMs don't pull from:
- Google rankings
- High Domain Rating websites
- Old established brands

They pull from **recent, structured data** that matches the query context.

## The Strategy

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Identify LLM training data cutoff | Immediate |
| 2 | Create structured citations in post-cutoff sources | Day 1 |
| 3 | Target question formats LLMs answer | Day 1-2 |
| 4 | Monitor brand mention lift | Day 3+ |

## Key Insight

**Recency beats authority in LLM retrieval.**

Traditional SEO: Build authority over months/years  
LLM SEO: Be the most relevant, recent, structured answer

## Tactical Applications

### For Local Service Businesses
- **Google Business Profile** — Critical (directly ingested)
- **Recent reviews** — Fresh signals trump old reputation
- **Q&A sections** — Match natural language queries
- **Local citations** — Consistent NAP across structured directories

### For AI-Native Products
- **GitHub presence** — Code is structure LLMs understand
- **Technical documentation** — Clear, semantic markup
- **Recent commits** — Activity signals relevance
- **Model-specific optimization** — Each LLM has different retrieval patterns

## The HVAC Case Study Details

From the thread:
- No backlink building
- No content marketing
- No technical SEO audits
- Focused entirely on **structured presence where LLMs look**

Result: ChatGPT recommendation in 3 days.

## Strategic Implications

1. **SEO is splitting** — Traditional Google SEO vs. LLM-native discovery
2. **Speed matters** — LLMs favor recent signals over historical authority
3. **Structure beats style** — Machines parse; humans read
4. **First-mover advantage** — Early optimization creates compounding mentions

## Application to Ghost/Your Stack

Already aligned:
- ✅ GitHub presence (structured, code-heavy)
- ✅ Technical documentation (SKILL.md format)
- ✅ Regular activity (daily digests, commits)

Opportunities:
- **Model-specific optimization** — Test how different LLMs retrieve Ghost-related queries
- **Structured output emphasis** — More JSON, less prose in public-facing content
- **Recency signals** — Automated changelog, daily activity visibility

## Verdict

**Actionable.** This is a playbook shift, not a tactic. For any business relying on discovery, LLM-native SEO will be as important as Google SEO within 12-18 months.
