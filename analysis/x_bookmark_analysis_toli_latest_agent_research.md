## Summary

**The Thesis:** Recent research has advanced agent design significantly. If you haven't updated your approach, your agents are likely outdated.

**The Urgency:** Rapid evolution in the field — staying current is survival.

## Key Insights

### 1. The Pace of Change
Agent design is evolving faster than most implementations:
- New patterns emerge monthly
- Best practices change quarterly
- What worked 6 months ago may be obsolete

### 2. Signs Your Agents Are "Broken"
- Inconsistent outputs
- Poor error handling
- No learning from failures
- Can't compose with other agents
- Lack of state management
- Brittle to prompt changes

### 3. What Modern Agents Need
| Capability | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Structured reasoning** | Reliable decision-making |
| **Tool use** | Act on the world |
| **Memory** | Learn from interactions |
| **Composition** | Work with other agents |
| **Reflection** | Self-correct |
| **Planning** | Multi-step execution |
