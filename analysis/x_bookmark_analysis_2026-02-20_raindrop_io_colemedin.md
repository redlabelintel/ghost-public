## Key Insights

### 1. The "Audio is Hype" Argument
- Audio features (Spaces, voice mode) get disproportionate attention
- Core capabilities (reasoning, accuracy, cost) matter more
- Users prioritize results over modalities

### 2. Strategic Implications
**For Ghost/Red Label:**
- **Validation of our approach:** Focus on cost control ($0/day) vs. flashy features
- **Differentiation:** Our value is reliable execution, not novel interfaces
- **Avoid:** Getting distracted by audio/voice hype
- **Focus:** Text-based, reliable, cost-effective agent systems

### 3. Action Items
- [ ] Continue prioritizing cost/efficiency over feature bloat
- [ ] Stay skeptical of "game-changing" audio announcements
- [ ] Double down on core value: reliable agent orchestration

## Priority: LOW-MEDIUM
