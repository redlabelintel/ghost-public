## Summary

**The Product:** Open-source skill that teaches AI agents to review UI screenshots like a designer — checking spacing, alignment, color, typography, responsiveness, and accessibility across 7 review categories.

**The Innovation:** Automated design QA that compares UI implementations against mockups and design standards.

---

## Key Insights

### 1. The 7 Review Categories
1. **Spacing** — margins, padding, whitespace
2. **Alignment** — grid adherence, element positioning
3. **Color** — brand consistency, contrast ratios
4. **Typography** — font sizes, weights, line heights
5. **Responsiveness** — breakpoint behavior
6. **Accessibility** — WCAG compliance checks
7. **Mockup Comparison** — pixel-perfect matching

### 2. Why This Matters
**Problem:** Design QA is manual, subjective, and time-consuming. Developers miss subtle design issues.

**Solution:** Automated visual regression with AI-powered design judgment.

### 3. Technical Approach
- Screenshot capture of UI components
- AI analysis against design tokens/mockups
- Structured output with specific violations
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
