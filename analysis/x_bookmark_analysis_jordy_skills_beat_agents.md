## Summary

**The Thesis:** Setting up OpenClaw is just the beginning. The real value comes from skills, not agents — and this approach saves thousands in fees.

**The Argument:** Skills-based architecture > Agent-based architecture.

## Key Insights

### 1. The OpenClaw Setup Trap
Many users:
1. Install OpenClaw
2. Create agents
3. Hit wall — what do agents actually DO?
4. Pay consultants/agencies to "help"
5. Spend thousands without results

### 2. Why Skills Beat Agents
| Agents | Skills |
|--------|--------|
| Monolithic | Composable |
| Expensive to maintain | Reusable across projects |
| Vendor lock-in | Portable |
| Opaque | Transparent |
| Requires experts | Self-service |

### 3. The Cost Argument
**Agent approach:** Thousands in consultant fees, ongoing maintenance costs.

**Skills approach:** One-time skill development, reuse forever.
