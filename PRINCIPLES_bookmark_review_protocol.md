## The Rule

Every time the CEO requests bookmark analysis:

1. **FETCH** live bookmarks from X/Twitter via browser
2. **ANALYZE** each bookmark individually with deep strategic assessment
3. **WRITE** each analysis as separate markdown file in `/analysis/` directory
4. **COMMIT** all analyses to Ghost repo with descriptive commit message
5. **DELIVER** absolute GitHub URLs for each analysis file
6. **CONFIRM** rule execution and compliance

## File Naming Convention

```
x_bookmark_analysis_{author}_{short_topic}.md
```

**Examples**:
- `x_bookmark_analysis_pedro_clawvault_primitives.md`
- `x_bookmark_analysis_raoul_pal_universal_code.md`
- `x_bookmark_analysis_kevin_simback_cost_optimization.md`

## Analysis Template

Each analysis must include:

1. **Header Block**: Source, date, URL, engagement metrics
2. **Summary**: Core thesis in 1-2 sentences
3. **Key Points**: Detailed breakdown of content
4. **Strategic Relevance**: Why this matters to current operations
5. **Connection to Current Systems**: Table mapping bookmark insights to existing infrastructure
6. **Implementation Ideas**: Actionable next steps
7. **Bottom Line**: Strategic value assessment
