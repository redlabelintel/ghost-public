# Team Meeting: Kimi K2.5 Hardware Analysis - Feb 13, 2026

## Meeting Summary
CEO requested minimum viable hardware analysis for running Kimi K2.5 locally after successful Qwen 2.5 7B deployment.

## Team Analysis Results

### Tesla (Architecture): High-End Requirements
- **Assessment**: Current Apple Silicon insufficient - needs 240GB+ RAM minimum
- **Recommendation**: Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512GB ($8K-12K)
- **Model support**: Full Kimi K2.5 with optimal performance

### Aaron (Performance): Budget-Conscious Analysis  
- **Assessment**: Mac Mini M3 24GB adequate for efficient deployment
- **Recommendation**: $1,400 budget option with 6-12 tokens/second
- **ROI**: 4-8 month payback vs cloud costs

### Patton (Strategy): Military Precision
- **Assessment**: Mac Studio M3 Ultra strategic investment
- **Recommendation**: $10K deployment, 22-month break-even, 54% 5-year savings
- **Strategy**: "Pint of sweat saves gallon of blood" - prevent future API bleeding

## Key Findings
- **Hardware requirement discrepancy**: Team analyzed different model quantizations/configurations
- **Cost consensus**: All paths show positive ROI for local deployment
- **Current solution**: Qwen 2.5 7B working at $0 cost - pressure off for immediate hardware decisions
- **Strategic position**: Token bleed eliminated, local deployment proven viable

## Current Status
Running 100% local with $0 daily costs. Hardware upgrade now strategic choice rather than emergency necessity.
