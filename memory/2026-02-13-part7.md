## Session Guardian Restoration & Interface Refinements

### Session Guardian Script Recreation
- **Issue**: Automated session guardian script missing, costing protection offline
- **Root Cause**: Lost during repository reorganization when scripts/ directory created
- **Solution**: Rebuilt `/Users/ghost/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/session-guardian.mjs`
- **Protection Restored**: Cost thresholds ($100 kill, $15 warning), token limits (2M kill), burn rate monitoring
- **Impact**: Prevents runaway sessions that previously cost $44+ and required manual intervention

### Command Center Interface Evolution
- **Problem**: React implementation had runtime errors, not operational
- **CEO Feedback**: "This isn't useful at all. I'm getting runtime errors. And I don't know anything that's going on."
- **Solution**: Created simple HTML/JS dashboard that actually works
- **Success**: CEO response "This is so much better"

### Design Preferences Further Refined
- **Critical Discovery**: CEO prefers **white background** over black
- **Final Aesthetic**: White background, black text, clean minimal interface
- **Consistent Elements**: IBM Plex Mono font, [BRACKET] buttons, no colors except black/white/grey
- **Interface URL**: http://100.76.103.90:8001/simple-dashboard.html

### Model Architecture Documentation 
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Provided comprehensive overview of multi-model routing system
- **Local Tier**: Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct (4.36GB) on Apple Silicon Metal
- **Remote Tier**: Claude Sonnet 4 via OpenRouter for premium reasoning
- **Cost Impact**: 60-80% API cost reduction, $0 for 80% of operations
- **Usage Patterns**: Subagents/cron → local, CEO direct interaction → remote premium

### Power Enhancement Initiative Launched
- **CEO Directive**: "Switch to white background version. Call the team together and brainstorm ways this can be even more powerful"
- **Team Standup**: CommandCenter-PowerEnhancement session spawned
- **Focus Areas**: Executive automation, predictive intelligence, one-click operations, proactive alerts
- **Philosophy**: Build on simple foundation that works, add power without complexity

### Real Data Integration Achievement
- **Completion**: CommandCenter-RealData delivered full workspace integration
- **Features**: Real todo extraction, meeting notes linking, project destruction controls
- **Operational Impact**: Dashboard now connects to actual workspace data vs. placeholders
- **Destructive Capabilities**: Project kill/archive functionality with safety confirmations

### Key Technical Lessons
1. **Simplicity Wins**: HTML/JS outperformed React for this use case
2. **Real Data Critical**: CEO immediately noticed lack of actual workspace integration
3. **Transparency Important**: System log showing what's happening builds trust
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple attempts led to working solution
5. **User Feedback Integration**: CEO preferences drive design decisions in real-time

### Operational Status End of Day
- **Command Center**: Fully functional, white background, real APIs
- **Session Guardian**: Rebuilt and operational for cost protection
- **Model Routing**: Documented and optimized for 80% cost savings
- **Enhancement Pipeline**: Power brainstorming in progress
- **Design Language**: White/black/grey minimal aesthetic locked in

This represents the culmination of the Command Center development effort, transitioning from complex specifications to simple, working operational tools that provide real executive value.
