## February 17, 2026 - Morning Session

### ClawVault Primitive System Deployed
**Time:** 09:30-11:30 AM GMT+1  
**Impact:** Major infrastructure upgrade to file-based memory system

**What was built:**
- 6 YAML schema definitions (agent-rule, identity, lesson, decision, task, project)
- Auto-generation script (`primitive-generator.mjs`)
- Primitive linking system (related_decisions, related_tasks, etc.)
- Updated AGENTS.md and SOUL.md with YAML frontmatter
- Created `/primitives/` directory structure with examples

**Key insight from Pedro analysis:** Simple primitives beat complex frameworks. Pedro shipped 12 releases, 459 tests in 72 hours by avoiding orchestration overhead.

**Immediate primitives created:**
- Decision: Adopt ClawVault primitive system
- Task: Deploy YAML schemas
- Lesson: Simple primitives beat complex frameworks

**Full documentation:** https://github.com/redlabelintel/ghost/blob/main/primitives/README.md

### Bookmark Review Protocol Established
**Time:** 10:00 AM  
**Rule:** Every bookmark analysis → separate .md file → commit to Ghost repo → deliver absolute URLs

**Analyzed 6 bookmarks:**
1. Kevin Simback - OpenClaw Cost Optimization (validates $290→$0/day strategy)
2. Adrian Solarz - $100M AI Content Machine (Grok + verified IG account strategy)
3. AK - Opus 4.6 + Figma + Cursor (AI design generation)
4. Pedro - ClawVault primitives (inspired today's deployment)
5. Raoul Pal - The Universal Code (systems-thinking framework)
6. Austin - Self-Improvement Digest (daily agent learning loop)

**All analyses committed with absolute URLs delivered.**

### Cron Job Fixes
**Fixed:** Morning standup was failing with "404 No endpoints found"
**Root cause:** Using local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct model causing OpenRouter routing errors
**Solution:** Updated 3 cron jobs to use openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
- Morning Agent Standup
- Evening Agent Standup  
- Sunday Self-Healing Audit

### Session Guardian Status
- Running every 15 minutes (08:53, 09:08, 09:23, 09:38, 09:53, 10:08, 10:23, 10:38, 10:53, 11:08)
- Main session: 69-75% context (healthy)
- Zero active sessions to manage
- No terminations or warnings issued

### Health Checks
**TWR Geo Bot:** All tests passing (webhook 200, stats 200)
**Auto-save protocol:** No new changes in agent-standups/ or command-center-dashboard/ at 11:00 AM

### Git Activity
- Total commits today: Multiple (bookmark analyses, primitive system, schema definitions)
- All changes pushed to Ghost repo
- No uncommitted work remaining
