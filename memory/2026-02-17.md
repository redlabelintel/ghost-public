- Music databases (AllMusic)

## Session Context

- Evening standup completed (compacted 156k→21k tokens earlier)
- All health checks passing (TWR Geo Bot 200/200, Session Guardian OK)
- Midnight auto-save pushed to Ghost repo
- Context at 67% after compaction

## February 17, 2026 - Morning Session

### ClawVault Primitive System Deployed
**Time:** 09:30-11:30 AM GMT+1  
**Impact:** Major infrastructure upgrade to file-based memory system

**What was built:**
- 6 YAML schema definitions (agent-rule, identity, lesson, decision, task, project)
- Auto-generation script (`primitive-generator.mjs`)
- Primitive linking system (related_decisions, related_tasks, etc.)
- Updated AGENTS.md and SOUL.md with YAML frontmatter
- Created `/primitives/` directory structure with examples

**Key insight from Pedro analysis:** Simple primitives beat complex frameworks. Pedro shipped 12 releases, 459 tests in 72 hours by avoiding orchestration overhead.

**Immediate primitives created:**
- Decision: Adopt ClawVault primitive system
- Task: Deploy YAML schemas
- Lesson: Simple primitives beat complex frameworks

**Full documentation:** https://github.com/redlabelintel/ghost/blob/main/primitives/README.md

### Bookmark Review Protocol Established
**Time:** 10:00 AM  
**Rule:** Every bookmark analysis → separate .md file → commit to Ghost repo → deliver absolute URLs

**Analyzed 6 bookmarks:**
1. Kevin Simback - OpenClaw Cost Optimization (validates $290→$0/day strategy)
2. Adrian Solarz - $100M AI Content Machine (Grok + verified IG account strategy)
3. AK - Opus 4.6 + Figma + Cursor (AI design generation)
4. Pedro - ClawVault primitives (inspired today's deployment)
5. Raoul Pal - The Universal Code (systems-thinking framework)
6. Austin - Self-Improvement Digest (daily agent learning loop)

**All analyses committed with absolute URLs delivered.**

### Cron Job Fixes
**Fixed:** Morning standup was failing with "404 No endpoints found"
**Root cause:** Using local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct model causing OpenRouter routing errors
**Solution:** Updated 3 cron jobs to use openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
- Morning Agent Standup
- Evening Agent Standup  
- Sunday Self-Healing Audit

### Session Guardian Status
- Running every 15 minutes (08:53, 09:08, 09:23, 09:38, 09:53, 10:08, 10:23, 10:38, 10:53, 11:08)
- Main session: 69-75% context (healthy)
- Zero active sessions to manage
- No terminations or warnings issued

### Health Checks
**TWR Geo Bot:** All tests passing (webhook 200, stats 200)
**Auto-save protocol:** No new changes in agent-standups/ or command-center-dashboard/ at 11:00 AM

### Git Activity
- Total commits today: Multiple (bookmark analyses, primitive system, schema definitions)

## February 17, 2026 - Afternoon Session

### AI Self-Improvement Digest Deployed
**Time:** 11:32 AM  
**Cron ID:** dce4ae3e-258c-41ff-b571-d9552a3a5560

**Daily digest system for agent self-improvement:**
- Scans Anthropic Engineering, Simon Willison, Hacker News + Tier 2 sources
- Filters for self-improvement content (not news)
- Generates 2-4 curated items with relevance ratings
- Mandatory Setup Review connects findings to AGENTS.md/TOOLS.md/primitives
- Suggests daily experiment
- Tracks in `memory/ai-digest-posted.json`

**Rate limit fix:** Brave Search free tier = 1 req/sec. Updated to use max 3 sources per run with rotation strategy.

**First digest:** Wednesday, February 18, 2026 — 8:30 AM

### Sunday Self-Healing Audit Fixed
**Time:** 12:10 PM  
**Issue:** Script failing with ES module error + CLI parsing issues

**Fixes applied:**
- Changed `require('child_process')` to ES module `import`
- Removed unsupported `--include-disabled` CLI flag
- Added proper CLI output parsing for error detection

**Audit results:**
- 9 healthy jobs ✅
- 2 need attention (Evening Standup auth, Sunday Audit)
- 4 disabled jobs (Red Label News Monitor, Marbella Weather, War Room Todos, Goliath Ventures)
- 0 stuck sessions

### Isolated Cron Jobs Switched to Local Model
**Time:** 12:25 PM  
**Reason:** OpenRouter billing errors on isolated agentTurn jobs

**Jobs updated:**
- Agent Standup - Evening: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` → `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct`
- Sunday Self-Healing Audit: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` → `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct`

**Cost impact:** $0 for these jobs going forward
