# Memory Log — February 19, 2026

## Morning Standup — 9:38 AM

### System Status
- **Active Agents:** 7 (Ghost, Patton, Buffett, Tesla, Aaron, Barnum, Bond)
- **Current Session:** Ghost on local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct ($0)
- **Silent Mode:** Active (reporting failures only)
- **Cost Status:** $0/day sustained

### Agent Project Pipeline
All 6 specialist agents pitched projects on Feb 18. Current status: **PITCHED** (no production started):

| Agent | Project | ETA | Priority |
|-------|---------|-----|----------|
| Barnum | Real-Time Agent Activity Monitor | 3-4 days | HIGH (shortest) |
| Buffett | Signal Subscription Service | 4-5 days | HIGH |
| Bond | Agent Security Command Center | 2 weeks | MEDIUM |
| Aaron | Ghost Platform Intelligence Engine | 3-4 weeks | MEDIUM |
| Tesla | Agent Workflow Compiler | 5 weeks | LOW |
| Patton | Autonomous Revenue Engine | ongoing | BACKLOG |

### Blockers Identified
1. **CRITICAL:** Default model mismatch in config
   - Config shows: `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5` as default
   - Should be: `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct` for cost control
   - Risk: Unexpected API costs if agents spawn with wrong model

2. **Gateway timeout on cron queries** - may indicate load issues

### Risk Alerts
- **Analysis without execution:** All 6 projects pitched but none in production
- **Cost configuration drift:** Default model doesn't match cost optimization strategy
- **Silent mode masking issues:** Only failures reported; successes hidden

### Today's Priorities
1. Fix default model configuration to local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct
2. Select first project to move from "pitched" to "in production"
3. Verify all cron jobs healthy after gateway timeout
4. Document decision on which agent project gets priority

## Research Completed — Ars Contexta Deep Dive

**Time:** 9:38-9:39 AM  
**Topic:** Claude Code plugin for knowledge system generation

### Key Findings

**249 Research Claims**  
Ars Contexta methodology synthesizes:
- Zettelkasten, Cornell Note-Taking, Evergreen Notes, PARA, GTD
- Cognitive science (extended mind, spreading activation, generation effect)
- Network theory (small-world topology, betweenness centrality)
- Agent architecture (context windows, session boundaries, multi-agent)

**Three-Space Architecture**
| Space | Purpose | Maps to Ghost |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `self/` | Agent identity, methodology, goals | SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md + AGENTS.md |
| `notes/` | Knowledge graph | MEMORY.md + memory/*.md |
| `ops/` | Operational coordination | Session logs + cron state + heartbeat-state.json |

**6 Rs Processing Pipeline**
Extends Cornell Note-Taking with meta-cognitive layer:
1. **Record** → Daily memory/*.md files
2. **Reduce** → Standup summaries
3. **Reflect** → Manual MEMORY.md updates
4. **Reweave** → *Not formally implemented*
5. **Verify** → HEARTBEAT.md checks
6. **Rethink** → Ad-hoc reviews

**Fresh Context Per Phase Pattern**  
Critical insight: Spawn fresh subagents per pipeline phase so every phase operates in "smart zone" before context degradation. Already used in Ghost's cron/isolated sessions.

### Adoption Recommendations for Ghost System

| Pattern | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Schema headers in memory files | Not implemented | Medium |
| `/reweave` weekly cycle | Manual, ad-hoc | High |
| Explicit `ops/` directory | Partial (logs scattered) | Medium |
| MOCs (Maps of Content) for analysis/ | Missing | High |
| Decision annotations (why + grounding) | Partial | Medium |
| Hooks (Write Validate, Auto Commit, Session Capture) | Cron-based only | Low |

### Decisions Made
**Won't install Ars Contexta** — Ghost's multi-agent orchestration more sophisticated. Will adopt specific patterns instead of full system replacement.
