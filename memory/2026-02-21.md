# Memory Log — February 21, 2026 (Morning)

## Visual QA Skill: EXECUTED ✅

**Time:** 4:05 AM (post-Airtable monitor)  
**Commit:** `b3c7016fe`

### What Was Done
Installed Dylan Feltus's open-source Visual QA skill — one of the 4 CRITICAL bookmark insights from Feb 20 evening standup.

**Skill Details:**
- Location: `~/ghost-repo/skills/visual-qa/SKILL.md`
- 7 review categories: Layout/Spacing, Typography, Color/Contrast, Visual Hierarchy, Component Quality, Polish, Responsive
- 3 output formats: Full Review, Quick Review, Comparison Review
- Source: https://github.com/dylanfeltus/skills

**Strategic Significance:**
This executes on the skill architecture migration pattern identified across all 4 CRITICAL bookmarks. Paired with yesterday's Ghost Design System v1.0 (design generation), Ghost now has design QA capability (design review).

**Generate → Review pipeline established.**

### Browser Limitation
Attempted live Visual QA test against docs.openclaw.ai, but browser control service offline. Skill ready for use when browser available.

## Feb 20 Priorities — STATUS

1. ✅ **Execute one CRITICAL bookmark insight** — DONE (Visual QA skill installed)
2. ⬜ **Start M6 production** — Q1 methodology piece pending  
3. ✅ **Fix Sunday Audit cron to local model** — DONE (gateway config patched, restarted)

### Sunday Audit Fix Details
**Problem:** Cron job failing with OpenRouter billing error despite local model in payload  
**Root Cause:** Default agent model was `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5`, isolated sessions fell back to it  
**Fix:** 
- Updated cron to `sessionTarget: isolated` with explicit model override
- Changed gateway default to `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct`
- Removed local model from fallbacks (it's now primary)
- Gateway restarted (PID 798)

---

## System Status

- **Model:** local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct ($0/day)
- **Session Context:** Healthy
- **Airtable:** Still down (monitor silent)
- **Commits Today:** 1 (b3c7016fe)

## AI Self-Improvement Digest — DELIVERED

**Time:** 8:30 AM  
**Items:** 4

   Key insight: Trace Analyzer skill pattern for iterative harness improvement

2. **Agent Harnesses: Why 2026 Isn't About More Agents** — DEV Community

**Logged to:** `memory/ai-digest-posted.json`

## Pre-Compaction Summary (8:33 AM)

**Session Context:** 71k/131k (54%)  
**Events Since 4:05 AM:**
- 8:00 AM: Daily health checks (TWR Geo Bot healthy, no todos)
- 8:30 AM: AI Digest delivered
- 8:33 AM: Model timeout recovery, session state preserved

**Airtable Monitor:** Still down (running every 5 min since 4:00 AM, 28+ checks, silent)

---

## Harness Audit Skill: BUILT AND DEPLOYED ✅

**Time:** 8:35 AM (post-digest delivery, CEO directive: "Do it")
**Commit:** `c78dc27a5`

### What Was Built

Implements the Trace Analyzer pattern from LangChain digest — harness engineering beats model swapping.

**Components:**

1. **skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md** — Full trace analysis framework
   - 4 parallel analysis agents: Tool Call, Context Window, Memory Retrieval, Session Flow
   - Structured output: 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Improvements / 🟢 Optimizations
   - Specific harness fixes with evidence and expected impact

2. **harness/** directory — Control plane specifications
   - `README.md` — Harness vs framework distinction
   - `tool-timeouts.yaml` — Centralized timeout configuration

3. **skills/visual-qa/SKILL_EVAL.md** — Component testing template
   - Intent detection tests
   - Tool selection validation
   - Output structure verification
   - Regression test cases

**Pattern Established:**
```
Session fails → Fetch trace → Parallel analysis (4 agents) → 
Synthesize findings → Specific harness fixes → Implement → Measure improvement
```

**Strategic Significance:**
- Self-diagnosing infrastructure
- Continuous improvement loop
- Specific actionable recommendations, not vague advice
- Pattern applicable to all future skill development

### Files Committed (5 files, 376 insertions)
- `skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md`
- `harness/README.md`
- `harness/tool-timeouts.yaml`
- `skills/visual-qa/SKILL_EVAL.md`
- `TOOLS.md` (updated)

## Feb 21 Summary (8:38 AM)

**CRITICAL Bookmark Insights Executed:**
1. ✅ Visual QA skill (design review capability)
2. ✅ Harness Audit skill (self-improving infrastructure)

**Remaining from 4 CRITICAL bookmarks:**
- Skill Architecture framework (Boring Marketer)
- Why Skills Beat Agents (jordy) — partially done via implementation

**Commits Today:** 2
- `b3c7016fe` — Visual QA skill install
- `c78dc27a5` — Harness Audit skill + control plane

**Still Pending:** M6 production (methodology piece)

---

## Morning Standup — 9:30 AM

**Standup report generated:** `agent-standups/2026-02-21-morning.md`

### Key Highlights
- **Architecture:** Single-agent mode (Ghost only) per Feb 21 directive
- **Cost:** $0/day maintained on local model
- **Session Health:** 18k/131k context (14%)
- **Git:** 20 commits (Feb 20-21), clean working directory

### Today's #1 Priority
**M6 Production Start** — Q1 methodology piece "How We Scope Engagements"
- Identified as priority Feb 16, still pending Feb 21
- 5-day execution gap on #1 editorial priority
- Action: Begin draft outline today

### Blockers
| Blocker | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Airtable outage (#2663) | 🔴 Active — operations continue without it |
| Cron delivery failures | 🟡 AI Digest + Evening Standup failing to deliver |

### Risks
1. **Execution gap on M6** — 5 days elapsed, February target (6 pieces) at risk
2. **Status check trust** — Feb 20 error logged, prevention protocol applied
3. **Cron reliability** — Pattern of delivery failures needs investigation

### Cron Health Overview
- ✅ Session Guardian, Auto-Save, Raindrop Sync, Todos, TWR Geo Bot
- ⚠️ AI Digest, Polymarket Arb (2 consecutive errors)
- 🔴 Evening Standup (2 consecutive errors, non-critical)

*Standup complete — Ghost*

---

## Afternoon Update (3:29 PM)

**Strategic Pivot Declared:**
- M6 methodology piece **CANCELLED** — article production discontinued
- Awaiting new directional mandate from CEO

**Auto-save Completed:**
- 9:00 AM: Memory files synced to repo (`185b78bd3`)
- `memory/2026-02-21.md` committed per CEO mandate

**Raindrop Sync:**
- 9:02 AM: 0 new bookmarks (4 in unsorted, all analyzed)

**Standing By:**
Current skills inventory ready for redeployment:
- Visual QA (design review)
- Harness Audit (self-diagnosing infrastructure)
- 5 other specialist skills

## Afternoon Events (3:28 PM)

**Payment Gateway Specification Received:**
- Source: HRgateway Dev via Telegram forward
- Gateway: `paymentgurus.io`
- Stack: React (frontend) + Node.js (backend)
- Model: Two-step server-side integration (no direct frontend→gateway)
- Currency: USDC on Polygon
- Key constraint: Unique encrypted wallet per order, mandatory provider validation

**Status:** Specification analyzed, awaiting direction on integration objective
**Context:** Forwarded shortly after M6 cancellation directive

---

## Evening Standup — 7:30 PM

**Standup report generated:** `agent-standups/2026-02-21-evening.md`  
**Commit:** `b4b16d5e5`

### Day Assessment: Strong Tactical, Weak Strategic

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ Both CRITICAL bookmark insights executed (Visual QA + Harness Audit skills)
- ✅ Self-improving infrastructure now operational
- ✅ Cost discipline maintained at $0/day
- ✅ Morning standup successfully executed

**What Didn't Work:**
- ⬜ M6 production: 5-day execution gap, ultimately cancelled
- ⬜ Cron delivery failures: Pattern of isolated session announce failures (AI Digest, Evening Standup, Polymarket Arb)
- ⬜ Airtable still down (28+ silent checks)

### Key Lessons
1. **Skills > Agents:** Architecture migration successfully implemented
2. **Harness engineering beats model swapping:** Trace Analyzer pattern deployed
3. **Execution gaps persist:** Large editorial items stall; need faster cancellation/pivot
4. **Cron delivery reliability:** Isolated session + announce mode has systemic issues needing investigation

### Tomorrow's Priorities (Sunday, Feb 22)
1. Weekly Sunday Audit (10:00 AM — auto-scheduled)
2. Weekly Pattern Report (6:00 PM — Phase 3 intelligence layer)
3. Cron delivery investigation
4. Payment gateway — await CEO direction

### Metrics
- **Commits today:** 10
- **Documentation:** 5+ files (skills + harness + eval templates)
- **Cost:** $0/day
- **Health:** Good
- **Cron failures:** 3 distinct (delivery errors, non-critical)

*Evening standup complete — Ghost*
