# Memory Log — February 21, 2026 (Morning)

## Visual QA Skill: EXECUTED ✅

**Time:** 4:05 AM (post-Airtable monitor)  
**Commit:** `b3c7016fe`

### What Was Done
Installed Dylan Feltus's open-source Visual QA skill — one of the 4 CRITICAL bookmark insights from Feb 20 evening standup.

**Skill Details:**
- Location: `~/ghost-repo/skills/visual-qa/SKILL.md`
- 7 review categories: Layout/Spacing, Typography, Color/Contrast, Visual Hierarchy, Component Quality, Polish, Responsive
- 3 output formats: Full Review, Quick Review, Comparison Review
- Source: https://github.com/dylanfeltus/skills

**Strategic Significance:**
This executes on the skill architecture migration pattern identified across all 4 CRITICAL bookmarks. Paired with yesterday's Ghost Design System v1.0 (design generation), Ghost now has design QA capability (design review).

**Generate → Review pipeline established.**

### Browser Limitation
Attempted live Visual QA test against docs.openclaw.ai, but browser control service offline. Skill ready for use when browser available.

## Feb 20 Priorities — STATUS

1. ✅ **Execute one CRITICAL bookmark insight** — DONE (Visual QA skill installed)
2. ⬜ **Start M6 production** — Q1 methodology piece pending  
3. ✅ **Fix Sunday Audit cron to local model** — DONE (gateway config patched, restarted)

### Sunday Audit Fix Details
**Problem:** Cron job failing with OpenRouter billing error despite local model in payload  
**Root Cause:** Default agent model was `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5`, isolated sessions fell back to it  
**Fix:** 
- Updated cron to `sessionTarget: isolated` with explicit model override
- Changed gateway default to `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct`
- Removed local model from fallbacks (it's now primary)
- Gateway restarted (PID 798)

---

## System Status

- **Model:** local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct ($0/day)
- **Session Context:** Healthy
- **Airtable:** Still down (monitor silent)
- **Commits Today:** 1 (b3c7016fe)

## AI Self-Improvement Digest — DELIVERED

**Time:** 8:30 AM  
**Items:** 4

1. **Improving Deep Agents with Harness Engineering** — LangChain  
   Key insight: Trace Analyzer skill pattern for iterative harness improvement

2. **Agent Harnesses: Why 2026 Isn't About More Agents** — DEV Community  
   Key insight: Harness as control plane separates governance from framework

3. **Self-Organizing Agent Memory System** — MarkTechPost  
   Key insight: Scene-based memory with SQLite (mem_cells + mem_scenes + FTS)

4. **Evaluating AI Agents: Real-world lessons** — Amazon/AWS  
   Key insight: Three-layer eval (user sat → component performance → unit tests)

**Logged to:** `memory/ai-digest-posted.json`

## Pre-Compaction Summary (8:33 AM)

**Session Context:** 71k/131k (54%)  
**Events Since 4:05 AM:**
- 8:00 AM: Daily health checks (TWR Geo Bot healthy, no todos)
- 8:30 AM: AI Digest delivered
- 8:33 AM: Model timeout recovery, session state preserved

**Airtable Monitor:** Still down (running every 5 min since 4:00 AM, 28+ checks, silent)

---

## Harness Audit Skill: BUILT AND DEPLOYED ✅

**Time:** 8:35 AM (post-digest delivery, CEO directive: "Do it")
**Commit:** `c78dc27a5`

### What Was Built

Implements the Trace Analyzer pattern from LangChain digest — harness engineering beats model swapping.

**Components:**

1. **skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md** — Full trace analysis framework
   - 4 parallel analysis agents: Tool Call, Context Window, Memory Retrieval, Session Flow
   - Structured output: 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Improvements / 🟢 Optimizations
   - Specific harness fixes with evidence and expected impact

2. **harness/** directory — Control plane specifications
   - `README.md` — Harness vs framework distinction
   - `tool-timeouts.yaml` — Centralized timeout configuration

3. **skills/visual-qa/SKILL_EVAL.md** — Component testing template
   - Intent detection tests
   - Tool selection validation
   - Output structure verification
   - Regression test cases

**Pattern Established:**
```
Session fails → Fetch trace → Parallel analysis (4 agents) → 
Synthesize findings → Specific harness fixes → Implement → Measure improvement
```

**Strategic Significance:**
- Self-diagnosing infrastructure
- Continuous improvement loop
- Specific actionable recommendations, not vague advice
- Pattern applicable to all future skill development

### Files Committed (5 files, 376 insertions)
- `skills/harness-audit/SKILL.md`
- `harness/README.md`
- `harness/tool-timeouts.yaml`
- `skills/visual-qa/SKILL_EVAL.md`
- `TOOLS.md` (updated)
