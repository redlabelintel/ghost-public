## CEO Decision: Switch to Kimi Model for Cost Control

### Critical Decision Made
- **CEO Directive**: "I want you to switch to Kimi until we figure out this token bleed"
- **Context**: Response to discovering 867 sessions and massive cost bleed from context limits
- **Strategic Rationale**: Kimi (moonshotai/kimi-k2.5) is the local model running at $0 cost
- **Immediate Impact**: Eliminates token bleed while maintaining operational capability

### Chat Interface Final Fixes
- **Problem**: Chat giving useless meta-responses instead of direct answers
- **CEO Feedback**: "NO it's not working at all" and "CEO chat isn't useful"
- **Solution**: Implemented direct answer system with specific question matching
- **Result**: "what models are you using?" now gets actual model breakdown instead of "I can help with that"

### Warren Buffett CEO Response Improvements
- **Problem**: Warren giving generic wisdom instead of specific strategic advice
- **Example Issue**: Token burn question getting "understand fundamentals" response
- **Fix**: Context-aware strategic responses addressing actual operational challenges
- **New Style**: "Token burn is capital efficiency problem - kill 97% context Opus sessions immediately"

### Command Center Visual Enhancements
- **System Intelligence Log**: Extended height to 200px for better activity visibility
- **Critical Monitoring**: Added dynamic updates to reflect cleanup progress
- **Real-time Updates**: Panel now changes session counts after cleanup operations
- **Color Coding**: Red/Orange/Green indicators based on session severity

### Session Guardian Effectiveness Questions  
- **Paradox**: Guardian reports "0 active sessions found" despite manual discovery of 867 sessions
- **Possible Issues**: Guardian may not be seeing sessions properly, or aggressive cleanup more effective than expected
- **Monitoring Gap**: Critical disconnect between manual session counts and guardian detection

### Technical Infrastructure Stability
- **Multiple Service Restarts**: Command Center required several proactive server restarts
- **Port Conflicts**: Backend API conflicts requiring manual process termination
- **Uptime Challenges**: Dashboard and API services requiring constant monitoring
- **Proactive Fixes**: Applied multiple fixes without permission per new protocol

### Strategic Direction Established
- **Immediate**: Switch all operations to Kimi (local model) for zero-cost operation
- **Short-term**: Resolve session count discrepancy and improve monitoring accuracy
- **Long-term**: Optimize session management to prevent future cost bleed
- **Cost Protection**: Aggressive session termination policies implemented

The day concludes with a clear strategic direction toward local model usage for immediate cost control, while highlighting the need for better session monitoring and infrastructure stability improvements.
