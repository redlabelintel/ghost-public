# Daily Memory - February 13, 2026 (Part 8)

## Powered Command Center Final Implementation

### Enhanced Power Systems Deployed
- **CEO Directive**: "Execute it now" for power enhancement brainstorm results
- **Implementation**: Created powered-dashboard.html with 6 executive automation systems
- **Features**: Auto-budget enforcement, predictive intelligence, one-click operations, real-time monitoring, proactive alerts, workflow optimization
- **Access**: http://100.76.103.90:8001/powered-dashboard.html
- **Design**: White background, black text, IBM Plex Mono as per CEO preferences

### Session Guardian Restoration Complete
- **Problem**: Session guardian script missing, causing API parsing errors
- **Root Cause**: Lost during repository reorganization phase
- **Solution**: Rebuilt `/Users/ghost/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/session-guardian.mjs`
- **Fix**: Updated to handle text output format instead of JSON parsing
- **Status**: Operational and ready for automated cost protection

### Critical New Operational Rule Established
- **CEO Directive**: "When these things happen, I need you to fix it on your own proactively and tell me afterwards"
- **Rule**: **PROACTIVE FIXING** - Fix operational issues immediately, report resolution afterwards
- **Implementation**: No longer ask permission for system/API fixes, just fix and inform
- **Applied**: Immediately fixed API downtime and session guardian parsing without requesting approval

### API Service Management
- **Issue**: Backend API went down, dashboard showing offline
- **Response**: Proactively restarted control-api.js without asking
- **Resolution**: API restored to operational status within minutes
- **Lesson**: System monitoring and immediate remediation now standard protocol

### Model Routing Documentation Refinement 
- **CEO Feedback**: "I need just the routing logic. Don't share use cases because it shares how I use it"
- **Security Concern**: Use cases reveal operational details that shouldn't be shared
- **Refined Approach**: Focus on technical architecture and system value, omit specific usage patterns
- **Business Value**: Emphasize cost optimization and reliability benefits without revealing operational secrets

### Key Technical Advances Today
1. **Command Center Evolution**: Simple dashboard → Powered automation systems
2. **Cost Protection**: Session Guardian rebuilt and operational
3. **Proactive Operations**: New rule for immediate issue resolution
4. **Design Preferences**: White background confirmed as final aesthetic
5. **Security Awareness**: Operational details protection for external sharing

### Final Status End of Day
- **Command Center**: Powered version operational with 6 automation systems
- **Session Guardian**: Rebuilt and protecting against runaway costs
- **API Services**: Restarted and operational
- **Operational Rules**: Proactive fixing protocol implemented
- **Documentation**: All progress committed to Ghost repo via auto-save

The day concluded with a fully powered Command Center providing executive automation, predictive intelligence, and complete operational control while maintaining the simplicity and aesthetic preferences established through iterative CEO feedback.
