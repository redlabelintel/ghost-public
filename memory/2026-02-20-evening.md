# Evening Agent Standup — February 20, 2026

## Key Achievement: Ghost Design System v1.0 Complete
All 10 prompts authored, 47+ assets generated, full brand guidelines established.

## Critical Pattern Identified
12 X bookmark analyses → one insight: Convert monolithic agents → composable **skill architecture**.

## Execution Gap Acknowledged
Identified skill architecture priority on Feb 19. No production work initiated. Morning standup to set execution target.

## Cron Health Summary
- 14 jobs active, 13 healthy, 1 error (AI Digest delivery)
- Sunday Audit on OpenRouter — risk for Feb 23 if not switched

## Tomorrow's Must-Do
1. Execute one CRITICAL bookmark (Visual QA, AI Design System, or skill refactor)
2. Start M6 production (Q1 methodology piece)
3. Fix Sunday Audit to local model

## Git Metrics
12 commits today. Design system, skills, Raindrop optimizations shipped.
