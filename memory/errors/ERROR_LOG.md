## Active Errors (Pending Resolution)

### Error: Provided Incorrect Status Information
**Signature:** `status-check-false-negative`
**First Seen:** 2026-02-20
**Last Seen:** 2026-02-20
**Count:** 1
**Severity:** HIGH

**Symptoms:**
- User reported Airtable outage
- I incorrectly stated "All Systems Operational"
- User had to push back twice before I found the actual incident
- Wasted user time, eroded trust

**Root Cause:**
- Cached or stale data from first web_fetch
- Did not believe user report
- Insufficient verification on status page check
- Overconfident response without validating

**Fix Applied:**
- Acknowledged error immediately
- Re-checked with fresh fetch
- Confirmed actual incident #2663
- Logging to prevent recurrence

**Prevention:**
- ALWAYS believe user reports first
- Re-fetch status pages when user contradicts
- Add "If you're seeing issues, let me re-verify" to status responses
- Never dismiss user experience with "all green" without confirmation
