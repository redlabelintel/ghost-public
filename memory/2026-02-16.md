## Morning Standup Complete

**Time:** 9:30 AM CET  
**Event:** Monday morning agent standup with Red Label editorial intelligence  
**Key Change:** Shadow Company now directs Red Label editorial process

---

### Editorial Intelligence Delivered

**Production Priority:**
- M6 "How We Scope Engagements" remains Q1 critical priority
- Shadow Company directive: Initiate production THIS WEEK
- Draft outline due Wednesday Feb 18

**X Posting Recommendations (Feb 16):**
1. Trump's Ukraine Minerals Deal (Analysis) — top pick for timeliness
2. Chip War/ASML Restrictions (Alerts) — supply chain relevance
3. How We Know When to Kill a Deal (Methodology) — authority builder

**February Status:**
- 16 days elapsed of 28 (57% of month)
- Behind pace on 6-8 piece target
- Methodology/Alerts ratio critically imbalanced (3:16)
- 12 days remaining for recovery

- Takaichi X post — UNCONFIRMED (needs verification)

New (Feb 16):
- Confirm Feb 15 X posts executed
- Execute today's 3 X recommendations

## Red Label Editorial Suspended

**Time:** ~10:00 AM CET  
**Decision:** CEO directed to abandon Red Label editorial workflow  
**Action Taken:** Removed all Red Label action items from active queue:
- M6 production/draft outline (was due Wed Feb 18)
- Daily X posting recommendations
- February recovery planning

**Status:** Shadow Company directive withdrawn. Cron jobs still running but no longer surfacing Red Label deliverables.

## PRINCIPLES.md Created and Committed

**Time:** Morning session  
**Trigger:** Analysis of Atlas Forge article "Why Your Agent Needs a Principles.md File"  
**Action:** Created PRINCIPLES.md with 8 core principles:

1. Default to Action
2. Real Over Perfect
3. Simplicity Is Power
4. Be Genuinely Useful, Not Performatively Helpful
5. Know the Room
6. Safety Without Paralysis
7. Memory Is Continuity
8. Disagree When It Matters

Plus resolution hierarchy for conflicting principles.

**Result:** Complete trinity now in place — AGENTS.md (rulebook), SOUL.md (constitution), PRINCIPLES.md (decision framework). Committed to Ghost repo.

## Anthropic Claude Code Analysis

**Time:** Late morning  
**Document:** "How Anthropic Teams Use Claude Code" (internal PDF)  
**Key Finding:** Anthropic's three-phase agentic workflow validates our architecture:

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Explore | Understand codebase, identify files |
| Plan | Pseudocode, map edge cases |
| Implement | Write → Test → Auto-fix |

**Validation:**
- ✅ CLAUDE.md pattern matches our AGENTS.md/SOUL.md/PRINCIPLES.md structure
- ✅ Subagent specialization matches Tesla/Aaron/Barnum/Bond/Patton team
- ✅ Tool permission gradients align with our safety protocols

**Gap Identified:** Anthropic emphasizes sandboxed exploration before production; we go straight to live systems (higher velocity, higher risk). Recommended adding `/sandbox` command to Command Center.

---

## Gateway Restart Capability Enabled

**Time:** 10:18 AM CET  
**What Was Needed:** Set `commands.restart: true` in OpenClaw config  
**Process:** Used `gateway.config.patch` to enable restart commands  
**Result:**
- `/restart` chat command now available
- `gateway(action="restart")` tool calls enabled
- Restart uses SIGUSR1 signal with 2-second delay
- Sentinel file tracks restart state

**Status:** Gateway will gracefully restart when triggered. Sessions auto-reconnect.

---

## TWR Geo Bot Health Checks

**Time:** Multiple checks (9:30 AM, 9:45 AM, 10:00 AM)  
**Status:** All green throughout morning
- Webhook: HTTP 200
- Stats endpoint: HTTP 200
- Total questions served: 200
- No incidents detected

## Emergency Fallback Mode Configured

**Time:** 10:23 AM CET  
**Problem:** When OpenRouter credits run out, system had no escape route — fallback chain was `openrouter/model → openrouter/same-model`

**Solution Implemented:**
- **New fallback chain:**
  1. Primary: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
  2. Fallback 1: `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct` (LM Studio, $0)
  3. Fallback 2: `openrouter/google/gemini-3-pro-image-preview`

- **Subagents:** Default to local model (free, background tasks cost $0)
- **Cooldowns reduced:** OpenRouter-specific billing backoff → 30 minutes (was hours)
- **Kill switch:** `/model local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct` forces local-only mode instantly

**Result:** Credit outages no longer cause downtime. System auto-switches to local LLM, retries OpenRouter periodically, switches back when credits available.

## Session Context Crisis and Auto-Compaction

**11:08 AM CET:** Session Guardian reported **102% context** (133k/131k tokens)

**What Happened:**
- Context exceeded 100% limit
- **Auto-compaction triggered** automatically
- Old tool calls/summaries trimmed
- Session continued with reduced history

**Status:** Session survived without restart. Now "running lean" — reduced immediate memory but all long-term files intact.

**Pricing Context:** Restart would have come back on local LLM (free) due to emergency fallback config. No cost risk either way.

---

## Ongoing Health Monitoring

**TWR Geo Bot Status:** All checks green (10:30, 10:45, 11:00, 11:15 AM)
- Webhook: HTTP 200
- Stats: HTTP 200
- Total questions: 200

**Session Guardian:** Scanning every ~15 minutes
- All sessions healthy
- 0 active runaway sessions
- Context monitoring active

---

## Session Context Note

**11:15 AM+ CET:** Following auto-compaction, session is "running lean." Long-term memory files (PRINCIPLES.md, daily logs, Ghost repo) are all intact and committed. Immediate conversation context is reduced but functional.

**For full context restoration:** A restart would bring back maximum working memory. With emergency fallback active, restart = local LLM at $0 cost.
