## PRINCIPLES.md Created and Committed

**Time:** Morning session  
**Trigger:** Analysis of Atlas Forge article "Why Your Agent Needs a Principles.md File"  
**Action:** Created PRINCIPLES.md with 8 core principles:

1. Default to Action
2. Real Over Perfect
3. Simplicity Is Power
4. Be Genuinely Useful, Not Performatively Helpful
5. Know the Room
6. Safety Without Paralysis
7. Memory Is Continuity
8. Disagree When It Matters

Plus resolution hierarchy for conflicting principles.

**Result:** Complete trinity now in place — AGENTS.md (rulebook), SOUL.md (constitution), PRINCIPLES.md (decision framework). Committed to Ghost repo.

## Anthropic Claude Code Analysis

**Time:** Late morning  
**Document:** "How Anthropic Teams Use Claude Code" (internal PDF)  
**Key Finding:** Anthropic's three-phase agentic workflow validates our architecture:

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Explore | Understand codebase, identify files |
| Plan | Pseudocode, map edge cases |
| Implement | Write → Test → Auto-fix |

**Validation:**
- ✅ CLAUDE.md pattern matches our AGENTS.md/SOUL.md/PRINCIPLES.md structure
- ✅ Subagent specialization matches Tesla/Aaron/Barnum/Bond/Patton team
- ✅ Tool permission gradients align with our safety protocols

**Gap Identified:** Anthropic emphasizes sandboxed exploration before production; we go straight to live systems (higher velocity, higher risk). Recommended adding `/sandbox` command to Command Center.

## Gateway Restart Capability Enabled

**Time:** 10:18 AM CET  
**What Was Needed:** Set `commands.restart: true` in OpenClaw config  
**Process:** Used `gateway.config.patch` to enable restart commands  
**Result:**
- `/restart` chat command now available
- `gateway(action="restart")` tool calls enabled
- Restart uses SIGUSR1 signal with 2-second delay
- Sentinel file tracks restart state

**Status:** Gateway will gracefully restart when triggered. Sessions auto-reconnect.

## TWR Geo Bot Health Checks

**Time:** Multiple checks (9:30 AM, 9:45 AM, 10:00 AM)  
**Status:** All green throughout morning
