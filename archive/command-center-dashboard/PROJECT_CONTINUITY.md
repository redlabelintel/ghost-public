# PROJECT CONTINUITY PROTOCOL
**Project**: Command Center Dashboard  
**Date**: February 13, 2026  
**CEO Directive**: "Make sure whatever progress we make here, we don't lose like last time."

## PROGRESS PROTECTION MEASURES

### 🔒 **VERSION CONTROL & BACKUP**
- ✅ **Git Repository**: All progress committed to `/command-center-dashboard/`
- ✅ **Daily Commits**: Mandatory commits every 24 hours minimum
- ✅ **Incremental Saves**: Progress saved after every major milestone
- ✅ **Branch Protection**: Feature branches for each agent's work

### 📝 **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**
- ✅ **Daily Status Reports**: Progress documented in `/agent-standups/`
- ✅ **Code Documentation**: Every function and component documented
- ✅ **Architecture Documents**: Technical decisions and rationale preserved
- ✅ **Meeting Minutes**: All discussions and decisions recorded

### 💾 **PERSISTENT STORAGE**
- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Progress tracked in database tables
- ✅ **File System Backup**: All files stored in workspace with git tracking
- ✅ **Memory Storage**: Key decisions stored in long-term memory system
- ✅ **External Links**: Important resources bookmarked and archived

### 📊 **PROGRESS TRACKING**
- ✅ **Milestone Checkpoints**: Clear deliverable tracking
- ✅ **Agent Accountability**: Individual progress attribution
- ✅ **Dependency Mapping**: Clear understanding of what depends on what
- ✅ **Recovery Plans**: How to rebuild if components are lost

### 🔄 **CONTINUITY PROTOCOLS**
- ✅ **Knowledge Transfer**: Cross-training on critical components
- ✅ **Handoff Documentation**: Clear instructions for task continuation
- ✅ **State Preservation**: System state documented for easy restoration
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Ability to return to previous working states

## SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS

### **Code & Architecture**
```
/command-center-dashboard/
├── README.md (always current)
├── ARCHITECTURE.md (Tesla's designs)
├── PROGRESS.md (daily updates)
├── src/ (all source code)
├── docs/ (comprehensive documentation)
└── backups/ (regular snapshots)
```

### **Agent Work Preservation**
- **TESLA**: Architecture decisions documented with reasoning
- **AARON**: Data pipeline code with database schemas preserved
- **BARNUM**: UI/UX designs saved as both files and documentation
- **BOND**: Security implementations with configuration guides
- **PATTON**: Project plans and roadmaps version controlled

### **Recovery Checkpoints**
- **Every 24 hours**: Full project state snapshot
- **Major milestones**: Complete backup with restoration guide
- **Before changes**: State preservation before risky modifications
- **Cross-agent dependencies**: Documented interfaces and contracts

### **Loss Prevention Rules**
1. **NEVER DELETE**: Archive instead of deleting, move to `/archive/`
2. **ALWAYS COMMIT**: Changes committed within 2 hours of completion
3. **DOCUMENT DECISIONS**: Why something was built, not just what
4. **PRESERVE STATE**: Current working configurations always documented
5. **MULTIPLE COPIES**: Critical components stored in multiple locations

## ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

### **Daily Requirements**
- [ ] Progress committed to git
- [ ] Status updated in tracking documents
- [ ] Dependencies and blockers documented
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined

### **Agent Responsibilities**
- **Each agent**: Maintain their own progress documentation
- **PATTON**: Overall project state tracking
- **CEO**: Regular review of preservation measures

## RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

### **If Progress is Lost**:
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine scope of loss
2. **Recovery Attempt**: Use git history and backups
3. **Rapid Rebuild**: Use documentation to recreate lost components
4. **Lesson Learning**: Update protection measures to prevent recurrence

### **Prevention Focus**:
- **Better than recovery**: Prevent loss from occurring
- **Redundancy**: Multiple copies of critical components
- **Clear Documentation**: Anyone can continue the work
- **State Preservation**: Easy to resume from any point

---

**COMMITMENT**: This project will NOT be lost. Every measure is in place to ensure continuity and recoverability.

**STATUS**: Protection protocols active from project start.
