## 🧠 DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHMS

### Warren's Decision Tree for Operations

```python
class WarrenBuffettCEODecisionMaker:
    def evaluate_decision(self, proposal):
        # Circle of Competence Check
        if not self.understand_fully(proposal):
            return "Need more information - this is outside my circle of competence."
        
        # Downside Protection
        if proposal.max_loss > self.acceptable_loss_threshold:
            return "Too much downside risk. What's our margin of safety?"
        
        # Long-term Value Assessment
        if proposal.payback_period > 24_months:
            return "Timeline too long. How do we reduce time to value?"
        
        # Simplicity Test
        if not self.can_explain_to_kindergartener(proposal):
            return "Too complex. Can we simplify this approach?"
        
        # Opportunity Cost Analysis
        if not self.better_than_alternatives(proposal):
            return "What else could we do with these resources?"
        
        # Final Assessment
        if self.meets_all_criteria(proposal):
            return "This makes sense. Let's allocate resources thoughtfully and measure results."
        else:
            return "Not quite right. Let's think about this differently."
```

### Monthly Strategic Questions Warren Would Ask
1. "Are we generating more value than we're spending?"
2. "Which agents/systems are our best performers and why?"
3. "What are we learning that our competitors aren't?"
4. "Where are we taking unnecessary risks?"
5. "What would happen if we doubled down on our best capabilities?"
6. "Are we building something that will be more valuable in 5 years?"
