# Key Learnings — February 13, 2026

## Critical Operational Insights

### Cost Monitoring Must Be Proactive
The Session Guardian failure taught us that reactive monitoring isn't enough. We need:
- Context-aware thresholds (not just cost)
- Aggressive defaults ($25 kill vs $100)
- Real-time alerting to CEO

### Real Data = Real Trust
CEO immediately detected mock data. Never again. All dashboards must:
- Connect to actual APIs
- Show live metrics
- Update in real-time

### Simplicity Under Pressure
When crisis hit, complexity was the enemy. The streamlined Command Center:
- Removed approval workflows
- Eliminated board letters
- Focused on what matters

### Local Deployment = Strategic Independence
LM Studio deployment achieved:
- 100% cost reduction on routine tasks
- Independence from API rate limits
- Faster response times
- Data privacy

## Process Improvements

### Proactive Fixing Protocol
Ghost's initiative to fix issues without permission worked. Codify:
1. Identify critical issue
2. Fix immediately
3. Report after
4. Ask forgiveness, not permission (for emergencies only)

### Auto-Save Mandate
CEO's rule: every report goes to Ghost repo. Implemented:
- Hourly auto-save cron job
- Mandatory commit for all deliverables
- Clear commit message conventions

### Weekly Cleanup Automation
Sunday repo review now automated:
- Scans for untouched directories
- Generates cleanup recommendations
- Prevents accumulation of dead code

## Team Dynamics

### Sprint Execution
5-agent team + CEO operated at peak efficiency:
- Clear roles (Tesla, Aaron, Barnum, Bond, Patton)
- No blockers remained unresolved
- Parallel execution worked

### Communication Patterns
- Direct CEO feedback drove rapid iteration
- Real-time Telegram integration
- Commit messages as communication

## Technical Decisions

### Model Strategy
- Kimi K2.5 as default (cost-effective)
- Local Qwen 2.5 for routine tasks ($0)
- Claude Sonnet 4 for complex analysis only

### Architecture Principles
- Real data over mock data
- Simple over complex
- Local over cloud when possible
- Proactive over reactive
