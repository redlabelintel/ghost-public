# Standup Report — February 19, 2026 (Evening)

## System Status
- **Date:** Thursday, February 19, 2026
- **Time:** 7:30 PM (Europe/Madrid)
- **Active Agents:** 7 (Ghost, Patton, Buffett, Tesla, Aaron, Barnum, Bond)
- **Current Model:** local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct
- **Cost Status:** $0/day sustained
- **Session Context:** 59k/131k (45%)

---

## Today's Accomplishments

### Morning Standup Completed (9:38 AM)
- All 7 agents accounted for
- 6 specialist agent projects in PITCHED status reviewed
- Ars Contexta research deep dive completed
- Configuration drift identified (default model mismatch)

### Research: Ars Contexta Methodology (9:38-9:39 AM)
- 249 research claims analyzed
- Three-space architecture mapped to Ghost system
- 6 Rs Processing Pipeline identified
- Adoption recommendations documented

**Key Decision:** Won't install Ars Contexta — Ghost's multi-agent orchestration more sophisticated. Will adopt specific patterns instead.

### Configuration Fix (Morning)
- Fixed critical default model mismatch
- Changed gateway config from OpenRouter to local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct
- Prevents unexpected API costs
- All isolated sessions (cron jobs) now route to local model by default

### Silent Mode Active
- Health checks configured to report failures only
- Reduces noise in Telegram
- Session Guardian, TWR Geo Bot, Crypto Bot run silently

---

## What Went Well

1. **Cost Control Sustained** — $0/day operations maintained across all 7 agents
2. **Morning Research Quality** — Ars Contexta analysis thorough and actionable
3. **Configuration Fix Proactive** — Caught default model mismatch before cost impact
4. **Silent Mode Implementation** — Reduced noise per CEO directive
5. **Documentation Current** — All memory files properly structured with schema headers

---

## What Didn't Go Well / Blockers

1. **No Production Progress on Agent Projects**
   - All 6 specialist agent projects still in "PITCHED" status
   - No project moved to "IN PRODUCTION"
   - Risk: Analysis without execution

2. **Sunday Self-Healing Audit Error**
   - Last run failed with billing error
   - Needs retry with local model

3. **Missing Agent Standup Protocol**
   - STANDUP-PROMPT.md didn't exist until now
   - Created protocol file this evening

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Default Configurations Override Per-Job Settings**
   - Critical insight from Feb 17 crisis
   - Default agent model affects all isolated sessions
   - Always verify gateway config after model changes

2. **Analysis Without Execution Is Just Noise**
   - 6 projects pitched but none in production
   - Need explicit selection and commitment
   - Recovery windows close fast (February has limited days left)

3. **Silent Mode Requires Careful Monitoring**
   - Successes hidden can mask progress
   - Failures-only reporting needs trust in system health
   - Standups become critical for visibility

4. **Research-to-Implementation Gap**
   - Ars Contexta research excellent but no immediate implementation
   - Pattern adoption prioritized over full system replacement
   - Smart decision given Ghost's existing sophistication

## Risk Alerts

| Risk | Level | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Analysis without execution | MEDIUM | Active — 6 projects pitched, 0 in production |
| Sunday audit failure | LOW | Needs retry |
| Configuration drift | MITIGATED | Fixed this morning |

---

## Tomorrow's Priorities (February 20, 2026)

### 1. Select First Project for Production
- Review 6 pitched projects with CEO
- Make explicit GO/NO-GO decision on at least one
- Move selected project to "IN PRODUCTION" status

### 2. Fix Sunday Self-Healing Audit
- Retry with local model configuration
- Verify all cron jobs healthy

### 3. Continue Silent Mode Operations
- Monitor for any failure alerts
- Maintain $0/day cost target

### 4. Agent Project Pipeline
| Agent | Project | ETA | Priority |
|-------|---------|-----|----------|
| Barnum | Real-Time Agent Activity Monitor | 3-4 days | HIGH (shortest) |
| Buffett | Signal Subscription Service | 4-5 days | HIGH |
| Bond | Agent Security Command Center | 2 weeks | MEDIUM |
| Aaron | Ghost Platform Intelligence Engine | 3-4 weeks | MEDIUM |
| Tesla | Agent Workflow Compiler | 5 weeks | LOW |
| Patton | Autonomous Revenue Engine | ongoing | BACKLOG |
