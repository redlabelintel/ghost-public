# Standup Report — February 20, 2026 — 9:30 AM

## Attendance
- Ghost (local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct)

## State Check
- **Model:** local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct ($0 cost, operational)
- **Context:** 36k/131k (28% utilization — healthy)
- **Tokens:** 230k in / 7.7k out (light usage)
- **Session:** Cron isolated session (this standup)

## Since Yesterday's Evening Standup
- 11 commits pushed to ghost-repo
- AI Self-Improvement Digest delivered (Feb 20)
- Raindrop sync executed (8 new X bookmarks → analysis templates)
- X bookmarks scraper implemented (Puppeteer + Playwright backups)
- Memory Systems schema created (Supabase hybrid architecture)

## Blockers
1. **Cron Delivery Failures (2 jobs)**
   - Evening Standup: "cron announce delivery failed" (last run Feb 18)
   - AI Self-Improvement Digest: "cron announce delivery failed" (last run Feb 20)
   - **Action needed:** Investigate Telegram delivery channel for isolated sessions
   
2. **Sunday Self-Healing Audit**
   - Last run failed with billing error (OpenRouter fallback triggered)
   - Model now local — retry should succeed

## Risks
- **Low:** Silent cron delivery failures may mask important alerts
- **None:** Cost at $0/day, all systems on local model

## Today's Priorities
1. **Fix cron delivery** — Test and resolve Telegram announce failures for isolated agentTurn jobs
2. **Complete Memory Systems implementation** — Build first piece of hybrid markdown+Supabase system
3. **Retry Sunday Self-Healing Audit** — Verify it works with local model
4. **Monitor Evening Standup** — Ensure tonight's run succeeds

## Metrics
- Commits since yesterday: 11
- Cron jobs: 12 total, 2 with delivery errors
- Cost: $0/day
- Health: Good (minor delivery issue)
