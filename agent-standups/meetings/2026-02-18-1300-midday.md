## 🎭 Agent Reports

### Ghost (Coordinator) 👻
**Since morning standup:**
- Health checks executed: TWR Geo Bot (200/200) ✅, Session Guardian (0 active, all clear) ✅

- Workspace migrated to workspace-ghost (new agent config)
- SOUL files confirmed in place for all 6 team agents

**Blockers:** None
**Status:** Operational

---

### Tesla (Chief Architect) ⚡
**Infrastructure status:**
- New multi-agent primitives committed: JUDGE pattern, freshness mechanisms, exit code conventions
- All cron jobs routing correctly — 0 consecutive errors across the board
- Agent workspace separation complete (workspace-ghost, workspace-tesla, workspace-aaron, etc.)

**Blockers:** None
**Flag:** Sunday Self-Healing Audit last run errored — OpenRouter billing/credits issue. Runs on local model but hit a failover path. Needs investigation before next Sunday.

### Aaron (Data Pipeline Engineer) 🔌
**Data status:**
- Auto-save protocol running (hourly git commits) — last fired at 12:50
- Repository clean: 748 insertions, 122 deletions in last 5 commits
- All meeting documents archiving correctly

### Barnum (UX/UI Designer) 🎨
**Status:**

- Command Center Dashboard marked v1.0 complete (since Feb 13)
- Standing by for new design/UX directives

**Blockers:** None

---

### Bond (Security Engineer) 🔒
**Security posture:**
- Email 4-layer duplicate protection still active
- Session Guardian scanning every 15 min — no anomalies detected
- Only 1 active session (main) — minimal attack surface
- No unauthorized sessions or cost anomalies

**Flag:** Supabase API key visible in Daily Todo cron payload. Low risk (restricted key) but worth noting.

**Blockers:** None
**Status:** Green

### Patton (Strategy Lead) 🎯
**Strategic assessment:**
- Infrastructure phase: COMPLETE
- Cost optimization: COMPLETE ($0/day on all automation)
- Agent identity phase: COMPLETE (SOUL files deployed)
- Next phase: Operational deployment — agents need real work, not simulated standups

**Open strategic items:**
1. M6 production (How We Scope Engagements) — still pending, 10 days left in February
2. Crypto trading bot running paper trades every 4h — needs performance review
3. Slack integration was attempted and crashed — needs retry

**Blockers:** Only `ghost` agent is configured for spawning. Tesla, Aaron, Barnum, Bond, Patton, Buffett cannot be spawned as independent agents yet.

### Buffett (CEO) 💼
**Capital allocation review:**

*Operational costs:* Excellent. $0/day automation sustained. Main session running on Opus (premium) but justified for direct CEO interaction.

*Resource allocation concern:* 6 agents have SOUL files but zero are independently deployable. They exist only as simulated personas in standup reports. To unlock real value, they need to be registered as spawnable agents with their own configs.

*Sunday audit failure:* The billing error on Self-Healing Audit suggests OpenRouter credits may be depleted. Not urgent (local model handles most work) but creates a single point of failure if local model goes down.

*Priority call:* Ship M6 before month-end. Everything else is operational maintenance.

## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

1. **Sunday Self-Healing Audit** — Last run failed with OpenRouter billing error. Needs credit check or full local model lock-in before next Sunday.

2. **Agent Deployment Gap** — 6 agent SOUL files exist but only `ghost` is registered as spawnable. Agents are personas, not autonomous workers yet.

3. **Slack Integration** — Previous attempt crashed. No logs found in session history. Needs fresh attempt.

4. **M6 Deadline** — 10 days remaining in February. No production started.
