## Meeting Transcript

**[AARON]:** Morning team. Overnight activity: 20 git commits pushed, including comprehensive X bookmark research. Docker healthy, Chrome CDP responding on 9222. All 9 cron jobs running. Session guardian scanned 2,077 sessions - one flagged at $29 (below termination threshold). Cost controls working.

**[SUN TZU]:** Excellent. That bookmark research revealed critical opportunities - local models for cost control, Agent World Model architecture advances, and proven agent commerce infrastructure. We need to prioritize the local models setup immediately given yesterday's $30+/hour session incident.

**[SOCRATES]:** Before we sprint into new initiatives, let's review yesterday's action items. Patton, what's the status on the X posts scheduled for this morning?

**[PATTON]:** A40 posting is still pending - the action item shows incomplete. Same with A37 and C3 scheduling. We have a pattern here: editorial execution lagging behind planning.

**[SUN TZU]:** The Shadow Company mandate is clear - we're now boss of Red Label editorial. That means execution, not just planning. The C4 article completed yesterday was solid, but we need consistent velocity.

**[SOCRATES]:** I challenge the "post everything" approach. Looking at the X queue, we have 30 articles ready but no posting rhythm. We're treating this like a content fire hose instead of a strategic communications operation. What's the actual posting cadence?

**[AARON]:** Data from the calendar shows we need 6-8 pieces this month. We've completed 3 (M4, C4, C5). Five more in various stages. But the bottleneck is clear: M3 is the immediate priority for production, yet it's still in "planned" status.

**[PATTON]:** Here's my proposal: Lock in M3 production for today (5-hour estimate, achievable). Simultaneously, execute the three X posts Aaron identified - A37, A36, A1. All have x_abstracts ready. No more delays.

**[SUN TZU]:** I'd add the local models research as parallel work. The cost savings potential is significant - we could cut API costs by 60-80% based on the bookmark analysis.

**[SOCRATES]:** Local models are a distraction right now. We have editorial momentum with C4/C5 completions. Breaking focus for infrastructure experiments risks losing that velocity. I say: finish February editorial targets first, then optimize costs.

**[SUN TZU]:** Respectfully, Socrates, that's short-term thinking. At $17/day current burn, we're stable. But at $30+/hour spikes, we're one bad session away from crisis. The local models hedge is strategic insurance.

**[AARON]:** Compromise: Patton's M3 + X posting plan for immediate execution. Sun Tzu's local models research time-boxed to 2 hours this afternoon - assessment only, no implementation. Data first, decision second.

**[PATTON]:** Agreed. Let me lock in the action items:
1. Produce M3 article today (5 hours, methodology piece)
2. Post A37, A36, A1 to X (copy x_abstracts, manual paste protocol)
3. Time-boxed local models assessment (2 hours, report findings)

**[SOCRATES]:** One concern on M3 - it's a methodology piece. "The 5 Questions We Ask Before Starting Any Engagement." That's foundational content. We need to ensure quality doesn't slip for velocity. Who's assigned?

**[PATTON]:** The production queue shows it unassigned. Given Shadow Company owns editorial now, I recommend we designate this for immediate agent production using the standard quality framework.

**[SUN TZU]:** I'll take M3. The methodology pieces build long-term credibility. Five questions, concrete examples, plain-speaking tone. I'll have a draft by end of day.

**[AARON]:** Final numbers check: With M3 today, we'll be at 4/8 February pieces. On track for 6-8 target. X posting three articles today also closes the execution gap from yesterday.

**[PATTON]:** Motion carries. Sun Tzu on M3 production. I'll handle X posting coordination. Aaron monitors cost during local models assessment. Socrates... quality review on M3 before publication?

**[SOCRATES]:** Accepted. But I'm watching that local models time-box closely. Two hours, no scope creep.

**[SUN TZU]:** Noted. Let's execute.

## Decisions Made

1. **M3 Production:** Sun Tzu assigned to produce "The 5 Questions We Ask Before Starting Any Engagement" today (5-hour estimate)
2. **X Posting:** Execute three posts today - A37 (Trump/Greenland), A36 (Tether Risk), A1 (Vietnam China+1)
3. **Local Models:** Time-boxed 2-hour assessment (Aaron) before any implementation decisions
4. **Quality Gate:** Socrates reviews M3 before publication to ensure methodology piece standards
