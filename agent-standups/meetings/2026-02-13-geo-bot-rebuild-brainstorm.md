- **Tertiary**: Gemini (consensus building)
- **Real-time**: Perplexity (current events)

**CONSENSUS REQUIREMENT**: 2/3 model agreement for factual claims

### Government API Integration
- **Tier 1**: USCIS, EU Open Data, OECD Tax Database
- **Tier 2**: CBI Unit websites, Golden Visa portals
- **Tier 3**: Treaty databases, legal sources

---

## 4. SUCCESS METRICS

### Accuracy Targets
- **≥95% factual accuracy** on ground-truth testing
- **100% program availability accuracy** via official sources
- **≤5 second response time** average
- **≥60% cache hit rate** for performance

### User Experience
- **Confidence indicators** on all responses
- **Source citations** with official links
- **Real-time change notifications** for followed programs
- **Sub-3-second** cached response times

---

## 5. BUDGET ESTIMATE

### Development Costs (8 weeks)
- **Personnel**: $75,000 - $150,000
- **Infrastructure**: $2,000 - $5,000
- **API Access**: $1,000 - $10,000
- **External Consultants**: $10,000 - $25,000

**TOTAL: $88,000 - $190,000**

### Monthly Operating Costs
- **Vercel Pro/Enterprise**: $100-500
- **Supabase Pro + PostGIS**: $50-200
- **Government API access**: $100-500
- **Monitoring/Analytics**: $50-100

**MONTHLY TOTAL: $300-1,300**

---

## 6. RISK MITIGATION

### Critical Risks Identified
- **Government API downtime** → Caching layer with TTL fallback
- **Model consensus failures** → Graceful degradation with uncertainty flags
- **Data staleness** → Automated freshness monitoring
- **Scope creep** → Strict phase gates requiring CEO approval

---
