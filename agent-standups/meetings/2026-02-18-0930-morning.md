- No security concerns identified — all file operations within workspace, no external exposure
- SHA256 hashing implemented for email duplicate detection

**Current blockers:** None

**Dependencies needed:** None

**Today's priorities:**
1. Continue monitoring for security anomalies

### Patton (Strategy Lead) 🎯
**Yesterday's accomplishments:**
- Sprint coordination: Day 2 of cost optimization initiative
- Achieved $0 operational cost through complete local model migration
- System reliability improved through infrastructure hardening

**Current blockers:** None

**Dependencies needed:** None

**Today's priorities:**
1. Verify Morning Standup execution (this meeting) — first full verification of local model default
2. Monitor all scheduled cron jobs throughout the day
3. Review any pending strategic items from CEO
4. Continue Red Label editorial planning (M6 production)

**Long-term context:** January M6 priority (How We Scope Engagements) remains Q1 strategic focus per Feb 16 analysis. February has 10 days remaining. Recovery windows are narrowing — action required.

**Assessment:** The infrastructure phase is complete. Now we can focus entirely on intellectual production without cost constraints or technical debt.

### Warren Buffett (CEO) 💼
**Strategic Assessment:**

*Capital Allocation Decision:* Exceptional. Yesterday eliminated the last cost center. We're now operating at $0 marginal cost for all automated processes. This is the culmination of the Feb 13 decision tree — what started as emergency triage has become competitive advantage.

*Risk Evaluation:* Very Low. All migration complete:
- ✅ Morning Standup (local model — being verified now)
- ✅ Evening Standup (local model)
- ✅ Sunday Self-Healing Audit (local model)
- ✅ AI Self-Improvement Digest (local model)
- ✅ Default routing (local model)

*Strategic Priority:* Shift from infrastructure to production. The Command Center is operational. Cost is zero. Now we build.

*Key Reminder from Feb 16:* M6 production (How We Scope Engagements) is still pending. February has 10 days remaining. The methodology gap is positioning — we need the Red Label methodology to show why clients choose us over commodity intelligence providers.
