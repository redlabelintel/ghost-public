# Agent Standup Report — February 20, 2026 (Evening)

**Time:** 7:30 PM (Europe/Madrid)  
**Session:** Ghost Agent Swarm (Isolated)  
**Model:** local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct

---

## Attendance
- Ghost (standup runner)
- 6 specialist agents on standby (Tesla, Aaron, Barnum, Bond, Patton, Buffett)

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Ghost Design System v1.0 — COMPLETE ✅
- All 10 prompts authored and executed
- 47+ brand assets generated
- Full brand guidelines documented
- Git commit: `cd9dd9148`

### 2. X Bookmark Analysis Pipeline — EXECUTED ✅
- 12 bookmarks analyzed from Raindrop
- 4 flagged as CRITICAL priority
- Key insight: Converge 7 monolithic agents → composable skill architecture
- All bookmarks tagged `analyzed` + `ghost-ai`

### 3. AI Self-Improvement Digest — DELIVERED ✅
- 4 research items surfaced on agent patterns
- Proposed session handoff patterns and STATUS.md template
- Tracking file `memory/ai-digest-posted.json` created for deduplication

### 4. Documentation Shipped
- Visual QA Skill added (first modular skill)
- Apple Design System skill added (10-prompt framework)
- Agent Readability Audit skill created
- Bookmark analysis tracker for preventing duplicates

### 5. Git Activity
- 12 commits today
- 932 lines added in X bookmark analyses
- Design system artifacts committed

## Blockers

| Blocker | Severity | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| AI Digest delivery fails | Medium | cron announce delivery failed — investigate delivery config |
| M6 production not started | High | Execution gap — analysis complete, no code shipped |
| Sunday Audit on OpenRouter | Medium | Billing risk — needs model switch to local |

**None currently preventing standup execution.**

---

## Risks

1. **Analysis-Execution Gap** — Pattern of analysis completion without production follow-through
2. **Resource Creep** — 14 cron jobs active, 1 error recurring — may need attention
3. **Sunday Audit Failure** — Last run Feb 16 failed with billing error, next run Feb 23 at risk

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Design system methodology works** — 10-prompt framework produces cohesive output
2. **Bookmark analysis accumulates value** — 12 analyses converge on one architectural insight
3. **Raindrop integration operational** — Daily sync + deduplication working
4. **Execution remains the gap** — Identified skill architecture 4 days ago, zero production code
5. **Local model proven** — All critical operations now $0/day, sustainable

---

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Feb 21)

1. **Execute one CRITICAL bookmark insight** — Pick from: Visual QA Skill implementation, AI Design System generation, or skill architecture refactoring
2. **Start M6 production** — Begin "How We Scope Engagements" methodology piece (Q1 priority)
3. **Fix Sunday Audit model** — Switch from OpenRouter to local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct
4. **Morning standup planning** — Set weekly targets for methodology production

---

## Metrics

- **Commits today:** 12
- **Documentation files:** 5
- **Cost:** $0/day (100% local model)
- **Health:** Good (1 cron error to investigate)
- **Session context:** Clean (~21k/131k tokens)

*Standup complete. Next: Morning standup Feb 21, 9:30 AM.*
