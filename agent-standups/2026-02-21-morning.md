- **Key commits:**
  - `b3c7016fe` — Visual QA skill install
  - `c78dc27a5` — Harness Audit skill + control plane
  - `185b78bd3` — Daily log + AI digest tracking
- **Repository:** Clean (no uncommitted changes)

### 💰 Cost Control

## Today's Priorities (Feb 21)

### 🔴 CRITICAL
1. **M6 Production Start** — Q1 methodology piece (How We Scope Engagements)
   - Status: PENDING from Feb 16 directive
   - Action: Begin draft outline today
   - This is the #1 editorial priority for Red Label

### 🟡 HIGH
2. **Complete CRITICAL Bookmark Execution** (2/4 done, 2 remaining)
   - Skill Architecture framework (Boring Marketer)
   - Why Skills Beat Agents pattern (jordy)

3. **Polymarket Arbitrage Scanner**
   - Status: Enabled, running every 4 hours
   - Last run: Error (delivery failed — non-critical)
   - Action: Monitor next run at ~11:30 AM

### 🟢 MEDIUM
4. **Sunday Audit Cron Verification**
   - Status: Fixed Feb 20 (gateway config patched to local model)
   - Next run: Tonight 11:00 PM
   - Action: Verify successful execution tomorrow morning

## Blockers

| Blocker | Status | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Airtable outage (Incident #2663) | 🔴 Active | External | Monitor status.airtable.com; operations continue without it |
| AI Digest delivery errors | 🟡 Intermittent | Ghost | 2 consecutive failures; check Telegram rate limits |
| Evening standup delivery failures | 🟡 Ongoing | Cron system | 2 consecutive errors; non-critical, investigate root cause |

### Blocker Details

**Airtable Outage**
- Down since Feb 20 (per user report)
- Status page confirms Incident #2663
- Impact: Airtable monitor cron running silently (as designed)
- Workaround: None needed — non-blocking for Ghost operations

**Cron Delivery Failures**
- AI Digest: Last 2 runs failed with "cron announce delivery failed"
- Evening Standup: Last 2 runs failed with same error
- Pattern: Isolated agentTurn jobs failing to deliver to Telegram
- Hypothesis: Rate limiting or channel connectivity

---

## Risks

### 🔴 HIGH
1. **Execution Gap on M6** — Priority identified Feb 16, no production code shipped by Feb 21
   - 5 days elapsed without action on #1 editorial priority
   - Risk: February output target (6 pieces) at risk with 7 days remaining

### 🟡 MEDIUM
2. **Status Check Trust Erosion** — Feb 20 error: incorrectly reported Airtable as operational
   - Fix applied: Always believe user reports first, re-verify on contradiction
   - Prevention: Error logged, prevention protocol in place

3. **Cron Delivery Reliability** — Pattern of delivery failures for isolated agentTurn jobs
   - Could mask important alerts
   - Action needed: Investigate root cause (possibly Telegram rate limits)

### 🟢 LOW
4. **Session Context Growth** — Currently healthy at 14%, but no compaction yet today
   - Risk: Low with 131k buffer
   - Monitor: Auto-compaction handles this
