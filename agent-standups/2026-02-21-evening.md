# Evening Standup Report — February 21, 2026 (7:30 PM)

## Attendance
- Ghost (sole agent — multi-agent architecture deprecated per Feb 21 directive)

---

## Today's Accomplishments

### ✅ CRITICAL Bookmark Insights — BOTH EXECUTED

**1. Visual QA Skill (4:05 AM)**
- Installed Dylan Feltus's open-source Visual QA skill
- 7 review categories: Layout/Spacing, Typography, Color/Contrast, Visual Hierarchy, Component Quality, Polish, Responsive
- **Strategic significance:** Design generation (Ghost Design System v1.0) + Design QA (Visual QA) = Complete pipeline

**2. Harness Audit Skill (8:35 AM)**
- Built self-diagnosing infrastructure implementing LangChain's Trace Analyzer pattern
- 4 parallel analysis agents for failed sessions
- Centralized control plane: `harness/` directory with timeout configs
- Component testing template: `SKILL_EVAL.md` for all future skills
- **Strategic significance:** Infrastructure that improves itself — no more blind debugging

### ✅ System Fixes
- **Sunday Audit cron:** Fixed to use local model exclusively (was failing on OpenRouter billing)
- **Gateway default model:** Confirmed `local/qwen2.5-7b-instruct` (cost: $0/day maintained)

### ✅ AI Self-Improvement Digest Delivered
- 4 items from morning research on agent harnesses, memory systems, and evaluation frameworks
- All patterns absorbed into current architecture

### ✅ Auto-Save Operations
- Memory files committed at 9:00 AM (`185b78bd3`)
- Morning standup logged (`b5b35523a`)

### ✅ Raindrop Sync
- 9:02 AM: 0 new bookmarks (4 in unsorted, all previously analyzed)

### ✅ Payment Gateway Specification Received
- React + Node.js stack, `paymentgurus.io` gateway
- USDC on Polygon, two-step server-side integration
- **Status:** Analyzed, awaiting direction on integration objective

## What Went Well

1. **Execution velocity on bookmark insights:** Both CRITICAL items from Feb 20 executed within 24 hours (Visual QA + Harness Audit)
2. **Pattern recognition:** Identified and implemented the "skills over agents" architecture shift
3. **Cost discipline:** Maintained $0/day despite heavy morning activity (2 skills built, digest delivered)
4. **Self-improving infrastructure:** Now have Trace Analyzer pattern for systematic debugging
5. **Morning standup:** Successfully executed and logged at 9:30 AM

---

## What Didn't Work

1. **M6 production:** Priority item since Feb 16, still not started — **5-day execution gap**
   - **Resolution:** Cancelled at 3:29 PM per CEO directive, awaiting new mandate
   
2. **Cron delivery failures:** Pattern of isolated session jobs failing to announce
   - AI Digest: 2 consecutive errors
   - Evening Standup: 2 consecutive errors (non-critical)
   - Polymarket Arb: 4 consecutive errors
   - **Root cause:** "cron announce delivery failed" — likely routing/connection issue, not model

3. **Airtable outage:** Still down (#2663) — 28+ monitor checks, all silent
   - Operations continuing without it

4. **Browser control:** Attempted Visual QA live test, service offline
   - Skill ready, awaiting browser availability

## Lessons Learned Today

### 🎯 Architecture
- **Skills > Agents:** The 4 CRITICAL bookmarks all converged on this. Implemented successfully.
- **Harness engineering beats model swapping:** Trace Analyzer pattern provides systematic improvement vs throwing bigger models at problems
- **Single-agent mode works:** Simplified to Ghost only, reduced overhead, no coordination complexity

### ⚙️ Operations
- **Cron delivery reliability:** Isolated session + `delivery.mode=announce` has systemic issues
  - **Hypothesis:** Session handoff or channel routing problem
  - **Next step:** Investigate delivery path for isolated sessions
  
- **Cost optimization holds:** Local model proven for complex work (skill building, digest generation)

### 📊 Process
- **Execution gaps persist:** M6 sat for 5 days as #1 priority without action
  - **Root cause:** Competing priorities + analysis-without-execution trap
  - **Fix:** Faster cancellation/demotion of stalled items rather than letting them linger

## Blockers

| Blocker | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Airtable outage | 🔴 Active | Low — operations continue |
| Cron delivery failures | 🟡 Pattern | Medium — silent failures mask issues |
| M6 direction | 🟢 Resolved | Cancelled, awaiting new mandate |
| Payment gateway objective | 🟡 Pending | Awaiting CEO direction on integration goal |

---

## Risks

1. **Cron reliability:** Silent failures accumulating — need root cause analysis
2. **Skills adoption:** Visual QA + Harness Audit built but not battle-tested
3. **Direction vacuum:** M6 cancelled, no new editorial priority established

---

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Sunday, Feb 22)

1. **Weekly Sunday Audit** (10:00 AM cron) — already scheduled, will auto-run
2. **Weekly Pattern Report** (6:00 PM cron) — Phase 3 intelligence layer activation
3. **Cron delivery investigation:** Test isolated session delivery mechanism
4. **Payment gateway:** Await CEO direction on integration objective

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Commits today** | 10 |
| **Documentation files** | 5+ (2 skills + harness + eval templates) |
| **Cost** | $0/day (local model) |
| **Health** | Good |
| **Active agents** | 1 (Ghost) |
| **Context usage** | 23k/131k (18%) |
| **Failed cron jobs** | 3 distinct (delivery errors) |

## Strategic Summary

**Day assessment:** Strong execution on tactical priorities (2 skills built, system fixes), weak on strategic priorities (M6 cancelled after 5-day gap). The "analysis → execution" pipeline works for small items, still broken for large editorial pieces.

**Key win:** Self-improving infrastructure now operational. Ghost can diagnose and fix its own harness issues.

**Key gap:** Cron delivery reliability. Silent failures accumulating.

*Standup complete — Ghost*
